What features this app has?


1) It converts numbers between binary and decimal range in both directions.

2) It has special system of checking like:

It checks has user typed a number at all. 
If it was a number for decimals, the app checks if the number is proper. 
It searches for zero symbols at the beginning and any dots in it. It checks like did user type a signed number, and it makes absolute value of it to work with it further.
If user typed binary digits it checks if it was a number in first priority, then does it contain any of digits that are distinguishable to 0 or 1 or it has dots inside.
